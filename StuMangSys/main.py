# ðŸ“Œ Project Suggestion: Student Management System (Console App)

# This will be a menu-driven Python app where you can manage studentsâ€™ details.

# âœ… Concepts it will cover:

# Variables & Data Types â†’ storing student info

# Input & Output â†’ menu & user input

# Operators â†’ ID generation, simple checks

# Conditional Statements â†’ menu options (if/elif/else)

# Loops â†’ repeat menu until exit

# Functions â†’ separate tasks (add_student(), remove_student(), etc.)

# Dictionary â†’ store student records ({id: {name, age, grade}})

# List & Tuple â†’ subjects list, immutable student IDs

# Set â†’ keep track of unique course names

# List Comprehension â†’ filtering students (e.g., [s for s in students if s['grade'] > 80])

# File Handling â†’ save & load student data in a text/CSV file

# Exception Handling â†’ handle wrong input

# ðŸ”¹ Features:

# Add Student â†’ ask name, age, grade, subjects

# View Students â†’ display all student details

# Search Student â†’ by ID or name

# Update Student â†’ modify grade or subjects

# Delete Student

# List High Performers â†’ using list comprehension

# Save Data â†’ write to file (so it stays after program ends)

# Load Data â†’ read file on startup
